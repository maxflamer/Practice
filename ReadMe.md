# Practice

Contains all the practice problems that I have done on my quest to become a good programmer.  


There are two directories within this repository:
- Data Structures
- Leetcode

## Data Structures
The project in this directory contains solved practice problems on Data Structures. It includes implementation of different data structures, algorithms using data structures, etc.

## Leetcode
This project consists of problems solved from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). Names of the sub-projects correspond to the names of the problems in Leetcode.

### Prerequisites
You will need [Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or above to run the project.
